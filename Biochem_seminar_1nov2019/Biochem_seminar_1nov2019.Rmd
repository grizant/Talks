# Science through interdiscplinary efforts

- Progress in many fields of scientific inquiry require experts from various fields: biology, chemistry, computer science, genetics, medicine, mathematics/statistics, etc. 
- Bioinformatics is a prime example of such a field, with interest and expertise across domains .
- When I was invited to speak here, Dr. Wallace said that many of you all are dealing with 'omics data and was curious what bioinformatic expertise is available on campus.
- So I'll share my thoughts on this and discuss 2 relevant biomedical gene expression projects.

# Special considerations for bioinformatics 

- There are many standard tools and pipelines to measure high-throughput 'omics data (such as RNA-sequencing, mass spectrometry, microarray, etc).
- There are also many choices available for the downstream analysis --- differentially expressed genes DEGs, pathway enrichment, etc.
- Keeping up with the advanced tools is a job in itself. We at UNR are lucky to have a bioinformatics core to run experiments, quantify (measure), process (noise correction, etc), and perform statistical analyses.
- If you have standard research question and experimental design, it is best to talk to them early and work together through the process. And enjoy the high quality data!

# What to do when conventional methods fail?

- But sometimes you'd like to understand data from nonstandard setups.
- For example, are your sample sizes inherently limited? Such as rare diseases / species.
- And sometimes you aren't sure how to conduct statistical inferences...

# So you result to looking at charts like this

\begin{columns}
\begin{column}{0.5\textwidth}  
    \begin{center}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Most developed in early 20th century, fragile, eclipsed by more recent tools
		\item Often users don’t know they are using models
		\item Symptom of naive adhearance to science through falisfication
	\end{itemize}

\end{column}
\end{columns}

# That is a good time to talk to an applied statistician

- When you are in this situation someone like me is a good collaborator.
- Discussions should begin early, not after getting the data and trying to recover.
- But most statisticians can't resist seeing data at any point, so it is worth a shot.
- Now I'll discuss 2 bioinformatic projects that resulting produced novel methods in challenging/nonstandard settings.

# Project 1 N1PAS

- Do alternatively spliced genes in tumor aggregate into biological pathways?
- Does this signal inform on cancer survival?
- Can this be discovered in a single-subject experimental design (nof1)?
- You need a tailored (bespoke) method to handle this question.
- This lead to the development of N-of-1-*pathways* Alternatively Spliced (N1PAS).

# N1PAS The general idea

\begin{itemize}
\item We'd like a methodology to estimate complex biological dysregulation using paired samples from cancer patients.
\item This dysregulation relates to coordinated differential protein isoform usage within biological pathways.
\item But we seek a single-subject framework for precision medicine.
\item Moreover, the setting involves large-scale simultaneous signification under correlated test statistics.
  \item This is extremely challenging when you only can analyze one patient's data at a time.
\end{itemize}

# Efron's local false discovery rate
   Assume that $N$ values can be sorted into two classes ('null' and 'nonnull'), occurring with probabilities of $p_{0}$ or $p_{1}=1-p_{0}$,
   \begin{align*}
     p_{0} & = Pr\{null\} & f_{0}(z), if \; null \\
     p_{1} & = Pr\{nonnull\} & f_{1}(z), if \; nonnull
   \end{align*}
   Define the \emph{null subdensity} as $f^{+}_{0}=p_{0}f_{0}(z)$ and the \emph{mixture density} as $f(z)=p_{0}f_{0}(z) + p_{1}f_{1}(z)$. Then define the local false discovery rate (locFDR) as the Bayesian posterior probability that a case is null given $z$,

   \begin{equation*}
fdr(z) = Pr\{null | z \} = \frac{p_{0}f_{0}(z)}{f(z)}= f^{+}_{0}/f(z).
     \end{equation*}

# Quantification of differential alternative splicing
  We follow Johnson & Purdom and use of the Hellinger distance to quantify alternative splicing between a pair of samples. Let the estimates of isoform expression for a sample $A$ be denoted as $x_{gA1},\ldots,x_{gAK_{g}}$ for the $K_{g}$ distinct isoforms annotated to gene $g$. We define the relative isoform usage as the vector of relative proportions of each isoform,
  $p_{gA}= \left( \frac{x_{gA1}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K_{g}} x_{gAk}}, \ldots, \frac{x_{gAK_{g}}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K_{g}} x_{gAk}} \right)$

  Then define the Hellinger distance
  \begin{equation*}
H_{g}(p_{gA}, p_{gB}) = 1 / \sqrt{2} \sum_{k=1}^{K_{g}} \left( \sqrt{ \frac{x_{gAk}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K_{g}} x_{gAk}}  }  - \sqrt{ \frac{x_{gBk}}{\sum_{k=1}^{K_{g}} x_{gBk}} } \right)^{2}
    \end{equation*}

\end{figure}

# Monte Carlo evaluation

  \begin{itemize}
  \item Trying the simulate parameterically is challenging as the isoform counts are ultra high-dimensional, multivariate, and discrete
  \item Instead we chose to permute in a subject-specific way:~find the distribution of Hellinger distances for the 4133 genes annotated to KEGG pathways. Then permute gene labels to create null distribution of pathway odds ratios.
    \item The effect size corresponds to the proportion of ASGs within a pathway $\pi$, relative to the subject-specific background level of ASGs ($\pi_{all}$).
  \end{itemize}

# Simulation settings and procedure
  \begin{itemize}
  \item 6 TCGA data sets explored, for a total of 246 patients.
    \item For each patient, compute Hellinger distances for each gene and use 2-means to cluster into ASG or not classes.
    \item Let $G=\{15, 30, 50, 100\}$ be the number of expressed genes in the specified pathway. Select at random a KEGG pathway with this number of genes.
    \item Let the effect size $\pi=\{0, 0.05, 0.10, 0.15, 0.20\}$.
    \item Select $G \times (\pi + \pi_{all})$ genes within the specified pathway at random to be from the ASG class and the remaining pathway genes from the non-ASG class.
    \item Apply N1PAS 100 times and determine empirical power as detection rate of the specified pathway.
      \item This results in 246 * 5 effect sizes * 4 pathway size * 100 reps = 492,000 simulated N1PAS runs.

    \item This will provide a single-subject method to detect alternatively spliced genetic pathways to enable precision medicine.
    \item We conducted Monte Carlo evaluations and find adequate false discovery rate control and impressive power to detect enriched pathways.
    \item We validated the method using target KEGG pathways.
    \item And applied N1PAS output to survival subtyping.
    \item Implemented an R package \url{https://github.com/grizant/n1pas/tree/master}.

# Project 2 Learning therapeutic resistance from circulating tumor cells (CTCs)

- Can prostate cancer therapy resistance be detected from single cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-eq) of CTCs?
- But it is experimentally and computational challenging to sequence CTCs.
- This results in only a few CTCs sequenced per patient.
- You need a tailored (bespoke) method to handle this question.
- This lead to the development of an *Analysis of aggregated cell-cell statistical distances within pathways unveils therapeutic-resistance mechanisms in circulating tumor cells* @Schissler2016a
